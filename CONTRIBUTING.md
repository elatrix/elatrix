# Contributing guidelines

## Workflow

1. Create a branch off `master`.
2. Create PR to `master` (yes, right after you created your branch).
3. Do your stuff.
4. Wait for reviews.
5. Fix.
7. Is it working? Squash & Merge!

## Branches

Branches naming is easy:
* If you're developing or fixing something, then it's `dev_<name>`.
* If you're writing docs, it's `doc_<name>`.

## Commits

Prefer using [structured commit messages](https://gist.github.com/stephenparish/9941e89d80e2bc58a153#format-of-the-commit-message) for large stuff and merges to `master`.

Use `<type>(<scope>): <subject>` format for commits in feature-branches.

## Versioning

No versioning requirements yet.
